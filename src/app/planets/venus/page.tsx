          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary
            neighbor. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly
            in the opposite direction from most planets. Its thick atmosphere
            traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest
            planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to
            melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed
            mountains.

          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            With a radius of 3,760 miles (6,052 kilometers), Venus is roughly
            the same size as Earth — just slightly smaller. From an average
            distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), Venus is 0.7
            astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit
            (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. It takes
            sunlight 6 minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.

          <PlanetSectionTitle title="Orbit and Rotation" />
          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            Venus' rotation and orbit are unusual in several ways. Venus is one
            of just two planets that rotate from east to west. Only Venus and
            Uranus have this "backwards" rotation. It completes one rotation in
            243 Earth days — the longest day of any planet in our solar system,
            even longer than a whole year on Venus. But the Sun doesn't rise and
            set each "day" on Venus like it does on most other planets. On
            Venus, one day-night cycle takes 117 Earth days because Venus
            rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital revolution around
            the Sun. Venus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in
            Venusian time) in 225 Earth days or slightly less than two Venusian
            day-night cycles. Its orbit around the Sun is the most circular of
            any planet — nearly a perfect circle. Other planet's orbits are more
            elliptical, or oval-shaped. With an axial tilt of just 3 degrees,
            Venus spins nearly upright, and so does not experience noticeable
            seasons.

          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            Venus is in many ways similar to Earth in its structure. It has an
            iron core that is approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) in
            radius. Above that is a mantle made of hot rock slowly churning due
            to the planet's interior heat. The surface is a thin crust of rock
            that bulges and moves as Venus' mantle shifts and creates volcanoes.

          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5
            billion years ago, Venus formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and
            dust together to form the second planet from the Sun. Like its
            fellow terrestrial planets, Venus has a central core, a rocky mantle
            and a solid crust.

          <PlanetSectionTitle title="Surface" />
          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            From space, Venus is bright white because it is covered with clouds
            that reflect and scatter sunlight. At the surface, the rocks are
            different shades of grey, like rocks on Earth, but the thick
            atmosphere filters the sunlight so that everything would look orange
            if you were standing on Venus. Venus has mountains, valleys, and
            tens of thousands of volcanoes. The highest mountain on Venus,
            Maxwell Montes, is 20,000 feet high (8.8 kilometers), similar to the
            highest mountain on Earth, Mount Everest. The landscape is dusty,
            and surface temperatures reach a scalding 880 degrees Fahrenheit
            (471 degrees Celsius). It is thought that Venus was completely
            resurfaced by volcanic activity 300 to 500 million years ago. Venus
            has two large highland areas: Ishtar Terra, about the size of
            Australia, in the north polar region; and Aphrodite Terra, about the
            size of South America, straddling the equator and extending for
            almost 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers). Venus is covered in craters,
            but none are smaller than 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers)
            across. Small meteoroids burn up in the dense atmosphere, so only
            large meteoroids reach the surface and create impact craters.

          <PlanetSectionTitle title="Atmosphere" />
          <PlanetSectionParagraph>
            Venus' atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of
            sulfuric acid droplets. The thick atmosphere traps the Sun's heat,
            resulting in surface temperatures higher than 880 degrees Fahrenheit
            (470 degrees Celsius). The atmosphere has many layers with different
            temperatures. At the level where the clouds are, about 30 miles up
            from the surface, it's about the same temperature as on the surface
            of the Earth. As Venus moves forward in its solar orbit while slowly
            rotating backwards on its axis, the top level of clouds zips around
            the planet every four Earth days, driven by hurricane-force winds
            traveling at about 224 miles (360 kilometers) per hour. Atmospheric
            lightning bursts light up these quick-moving clouds. Speeds within
            the clouds decrease with cloud height, and at the surface are
            estimated to be just a few miles per hour. On the ground, it would
            look like a very hazy, overcast day on Earth. And the atmosphere is
            so heavy it would feel like you were 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) deep
            underwater.

            Even though Venus is similar in size to the Earth and has a
            similarly-sized iron core, Venus' magnetic field is much weaker than
            the Earth's due to Venus' slow rotation.
